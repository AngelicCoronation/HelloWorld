In a bit to correct the conflict on the path of git pull request, I deleted a file which i probably should'nt have deleted. Trying to navigate my way out of my error. I wanted to merge the branch i created to the main branch but it seems i merged the wrong way.
I am a newbie in programming and I will sure need loads of help from the Github community. Thankfully I am have tried to run my first branch different from the main branch and i made 5 commits already, though still learning to master some commands. thanks for being patient with me.
